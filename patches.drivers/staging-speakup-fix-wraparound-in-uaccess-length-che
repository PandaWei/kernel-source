Subject: [PATCH] staging: speakup: fix wraparound in uaccess length check
Git-commit: b96fba8d5855c3617adbfb43ca4723a808cac954
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc7
References: bsc#1051510

If softsynthx_read() is called with `count < 3`, `count - 3` wraps, causing
the loop to copy as much data as available to the provided buffer. If
softsynthx_read() is invoked through sys_splice(), this causes an
unbounded kernel write; but even when userspace just reads from it
normally, a small size could cause userspace crashes.
