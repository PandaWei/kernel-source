Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm: Fix possible null dereference on failure of get_pages()
Git-commit: 3976626ea3d2011f8fd3f3a47070a8b792018253
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc3
References: bsc#1051510

Commit 62e3a3e342af changed get_pages() to initialise
msm_gem_object::pages before trying to initialise msm_gem_object::sgt,
so that put_pages() would properly clean up pages in the failure
case.

However, this means that put_pages() now needs to check that
msm_gem_object::sgt is not null before trying to clean it up, and
this check was only applied to part of the cleanup code.  Move
it all into the conditional block.  (Strictly speaking we don't
need to make the kfree() conditional, but since we can't avoid
checking for null ourselves we may as well do so.)
