Subject: [PATCH] nvmet: switch loopback target state to connecting when
 resetting
References: bsc#1098527
Git-commit: 8bfc3b4c6f9de815de4ab73784b9419348266a65
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc4

After commit bb06ec31452f ("nvme: expand nvmf_check_if_ready checks")
resetting of the loopback nvme target failed as we forgot to switch
it's state to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING before we reconnect the admin
queues. Therefore the checks in nvmf_check_if_ready() choose to go to
the reject_io case and thus we couldn't sent out an identify
controller command to reconnect.

Change the controller state to NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING after tearing down
the old connection and before re-establishing the connection.

Fixes: bb06ec31452f ("nvme: expand nvmf_check_if_ready checks")
