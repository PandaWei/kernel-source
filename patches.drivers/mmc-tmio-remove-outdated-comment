Subject: [PATCH] mmc: tmio: remove outdated comment
Git-commit: c592742468517228faf3688d64f0cee109816de4
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

The obviously wrong comment was added in 2011 with commit df3ef2d3c92c0a
("mmc: protect the tmio_mmc driver against a theoretical race") but
already obsoleted half a year later with commit b9269fdd4f61aa ("mmc:
Tmio: fix recursive spinlock, don't schedule with interrupts disabled").

Fixes: b9269fdd4f61aa ("mmc: tmio: fix recursive spinlock, don't schedule with interrupts disabled")
