Subject: [PATCH] clk: clk-fixed-factor: Clear OF_POPULATED flag in case of failure
Git-commit: f6dab4233d6b64d719109040503b567f71fbfa01
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

Fixed factor clock has two initializations at of_clk_init() time
and during platform driver probe. Before of_clk_init() call,
node is marked as populated and so its probe never gets called.

During of_clk_init() fixed factor clock registration may fail if
any of its parent clock is not registered. In this case, it doesn't
get chance to retry registration from probe. Clear OF_POPULATED
flag if fixed factor clock registration fails so that clock
registration is attempted again from probe.
