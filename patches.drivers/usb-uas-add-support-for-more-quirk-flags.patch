Subject: [PATCH] usb: uas: add support for more quirk flags
Git-commit: 42d1c6d4a06a77b3ab206a919b9050c3080f3a71
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc4
References: bsc#1051510

The hope that UAS devices would be less broken than old style storage
devices has turned out to be unfounded. Make UAS support more of the
quirk flags of the old driver.
