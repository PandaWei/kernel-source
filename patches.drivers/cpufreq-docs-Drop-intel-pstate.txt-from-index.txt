Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: docs: Drop intel-pstate.txt from index.txt
Git-commit: 8aba2333904f9b1c1ea038df261bf7ae8fefb98e
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc3
References: bsc#1051510

Commit 33fc30b47098 (cpufreq: intel_pstate: Document the current
behavior and user interface) dropped the intel-pstate.txt file
from Documentation/cpu-freq/, but it did not update the index.txt
file in there accordingly, so do that now.
