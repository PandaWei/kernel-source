Subject: [PATCH] tee: check shm references are consistent in offset/size
Git-commit: ab9d3db5b320a052452b9cd035599ee3c84bbee9
Patch-mainline: v4.17-rc6
References: bsc#1051510

This change prevents userland from referencing TEE shared memory
outside the area initially allocated by its owner. Prior this change an
application could not reference or access memory it did not own but
it could reference memory not explicitly allocated by owner but still
allocated to the owner due to the memory allocation granule.
