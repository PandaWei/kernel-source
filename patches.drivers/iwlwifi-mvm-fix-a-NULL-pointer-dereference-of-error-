Subject: [PATCH] iwlwifi: mvm: fix a NULL pointer dereference of error in recovery
Git-commit: 61dd8a8a6a0c3cbfb6b02ab652c4f4efb93f3d79
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc4
References: bsc#1051510

Sometimes, we can have an firmware crash while trying to
recover from a previous firmware problem.
When that happens, lots of things can go wrong. For example
the stations don't get added properly to mvm->fw_id_to_mac_id.

Mac80211 tries to stop A-MPDU upon reconfig but in case of
a firmware crash we will bail out fairly early and in the
end, we won't delete the A-MPDU Rx timeout.
When that timer expired after a double firmware crash,
we end up dereferencing mvm->fw_id_to_mac_id[sta_id]
which is NULL.
