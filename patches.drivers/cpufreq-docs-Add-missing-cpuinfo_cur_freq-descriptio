Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq: docs: Add missing cpuinfo_cur_freq description
Git-commit: c2e3af11a979688bc9b9229867688e89e343a465
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc4
References: bsc#1051510

Add a description of the cpuinfo_cur_freq policy attribute in sysfs
to the cpufreq documentation under Documentation/admin-guide/pm/ as
it is missing after commit 2a0e49279850 (cpufreq: User/admin
documentation update and consolidation) that overlooked it.
