Subject: [PATCH] wl1251: check return from call to wl1251_acx_arp_ip_filter
Git-commit: ac1181c60822292176ab96912208ec9f9819faf8
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

Currently the less than zero error check on ret is incorrect
as it is checking a far earlier ret assignment rather than the
return from the call to wl1251_acx_arp_ip_filter. Fix this by
adding in the missing assginment.
