Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda/ca0132: make array ca0132_alt_chmaps static
Git-commit: 9c4a665ed83462039461dd34282e22160fb447ca
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc3
References: bsc#1051510

The array ca0132_alt_chmaps is local to the source and does not
need to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warning:
Warning: symbol 'ca0132_alt_chmaps' was not declared. Should it be
static?
