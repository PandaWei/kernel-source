Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: samsung: Fix invalid argument when devm_gpiod_get is called
Git-commit: 975b6a93088e83a41ba2f0dec2f086678fdb2a7a
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

devm_gpiod_get is called with GPIOF_OUT_INIT_LOW but the function doesn't
allow the parameters. Unluckily, GPIOF_OUT_INIT_LOW is same value as
GPIOD_ASIS and gpio direction isn't set properly.

Muted stream comes up when I try recording some sounds on TM2. mic-bias
gpiod state can't be changed because the gpiod is created with the invalid
parameter. The gpio should be set GPIOD_OUT_HIGH.
