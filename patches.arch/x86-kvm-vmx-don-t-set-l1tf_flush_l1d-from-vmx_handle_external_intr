Subject: x86/KVM/VMX: Don't set l1tf_flush_l1d from vmx_handle_external_intr()
Git-commit: 18b57ce2eb8c8b9a24174a89250cf5f57c76ecdc
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
References: bsc#1110006

For VMEXITs caused by external interrupts, vmx_handle_external_intr()
indirectly calls into the interrupt handlers through the host's IDT.

It follows that these interrupts get accounted for in the
kvm_cpu_l1tf_flush_l1d per-cpu flag.

The subsequently executed vmx_l1d_flush() will thus be aware that some
interrupts have happened and conduct a L1d flush anyway.

Setting l1tf_flush_l1d from vmx_handle_external_intr() isn't needed
anymore. Drop it.
