Subject: ceph: fix st_nlink stat for directories
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: git://github.com/ceph/ceph-client
Git-commit: 2ddcb9a1b4c7a07f322090677334bbfeee0206d9
References: bsc#1093904

Currently, calling stat on a cephfs directory returns 1 for st_nlink.
This behaviour has recently changed in the fuse client, as some
applications seem to expect this value to be either 0 (if it's
unlinked) or 2 + number of subdirectories.  This behaviour was changed
in the fuse client with commit 67c7e4619188 ("client: use common
interp of st_nlink for dirs").

This patch modifies the kernel client to have a similar behaviour.
