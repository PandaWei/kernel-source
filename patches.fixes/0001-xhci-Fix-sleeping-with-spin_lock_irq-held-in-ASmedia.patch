Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Fix sleeping with spin_lock_irq() held in ASmedia 1042A
 workaround
Git-commit: 4ec1cd3eeeee7ccc35681270da028dbc29ca7bbd
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc4
References: bsc#1085536

The flow control workaround for ASM1042A xHC hosts sleeps between
register polling. The workaround gets called in several places, among
them with spin_lock_irq() held when xHC host is resumed or hoplug removed.

This was noticed as kernel panics at resume on a Dell XPS15 9550 with
TB16 thunderbolt dock.

Avoid sleeping with spin_lock_irq() held, use udelay() instead

The original workaround was added to 4.9 and 4.12 stable releases,
this patch needs to be applied to those as well.
