Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mm,vmacache: optimize overflow system-wide flushing"
Patch-mainline: Never, SLE specific
References: bsc#1108399 CVE-2018-17182

This reverts:

    6b4ebc3a9078 (mm,vmacache: optimize overflow system-wide flushing)

Due to kabi constraints, this fix is a SLE-specific change,
which is equivalent to upstream's approach:

   7a9cdebdcc17 (mm: get rid of vmacache_flush_all() entirely)

By disabling the "fastpath" (which isn't even fast as this is
rarely run code paths) we deal with the security flaw.
