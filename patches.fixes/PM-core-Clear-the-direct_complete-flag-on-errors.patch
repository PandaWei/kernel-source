Subject: [PATCH] PM / core: Clear the direct_complete flag on errors
Git-commit: 69e445ab8b66a9f30519842ef18be555d3ee9b51
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc7
References: bsc#1051510

If __device_suspend() runs asynchronously (in which case the device
passed to it is in dpm_suspended_list at that point) and it returns
early on an error or pending wakeup, and the power.direct_complete
flag has been set for the device already, the subsequent
device_resume() will be confused by that and it will call
pm_runtime_enable() incorrectly, as runtime PM has not been
disabled for the device by __device_suspend().

To avoid that, clear power.direct_complete if __device_suspend()
is not going to disable runtime PM for the device before returning.

Fixes: aae4518b3124 (PM / sleep: Mechanism to avoid resuming runtime-suspended devices unnecessarily)
