Subject: cpuidle: fix broadcast control when broadcast can not be entered
Git-commit: f187851b9b4a76952b1158b86434563dd2031103
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: Git-fixes

When failing to enter broadcast timer mode for an idle state that
requires it, a new state is selected that does not require broadcast,
but the broadcast variable remains set. This causes
tick_broadcast_exit to be called despite not having entered broadcast
mode.

This causes the WARN_ON_ONCE(!irqs_disabled()) to trigger in some
cases. It does not appear to cause problems for code today, but seems
to violate the interface so should be fixed.
