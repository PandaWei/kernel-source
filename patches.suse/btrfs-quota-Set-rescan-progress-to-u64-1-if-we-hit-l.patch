Subject: btrfs: quota: Set rescan progress to (u64)-1 if we hit last leaf
Git-commit: 6f7de19ed3d4d3526ca5eca428009f97cf969c2f
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc3
References: git-fixes

Commit ff3d27a048d9 ("btrfs: qgroup: Finish rescan when hit the last leaf
of extent tree") added a new exit for rescan finish.

However after finishing quota rescan, we set
fs_info->qgroup_rescan_progress to (u64)-1 before we exit through the
original exit path.
While we missed that assignment of (u64)-1 in the new exit path.

The end result is, the quota status item doesn't have the same value.
(-1 vs the last bytenr + 1)
Although it doesn't affect quota accounting, it's still better to keep
the original behavior.
