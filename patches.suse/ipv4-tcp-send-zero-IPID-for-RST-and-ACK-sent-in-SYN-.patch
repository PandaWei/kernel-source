Subject: ipv4: tcp: send zero IPID for RST and ACK sent in SYN-RECV and
 TIME-WAIT state
Git-commit: 431280eebed9f5079553daf003011097763e71fd
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc2
References: networking-stable-18_09_11

tcp uses per-cpu (and per namespace) sockets (net->ipv4.tcp_sk) internally
to send some control packets.

1) RST packets, through tcp_v4_send_reset()
2) ACK packets in SYN-RECV and TIME-WAIT state, through tcp_v4_send_ack()

These packets assert IP_DF, and also use the hashed IP ident generator
to provide an IPv4 ID number.

Geoff Alexander reported this could be used to build off-path attacks.

These packets should not be fragmented, since their size is smaller than
IPV4_MIN_MTU. Only some tunneled paths could eventually have to fragment,
regardless of inner IPID.

We really can use zero IPID, to address the flaw, and as a bonus,
avoid a couple of atomic operations in ip_idents_reserve()
