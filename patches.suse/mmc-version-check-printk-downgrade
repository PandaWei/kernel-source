Subject: Downgrade printk level for MMC SDHCI host version error
Patch-mainline: Never, SLE15 only
References: bsc#1097941

MMC SDHCI drivers spew an error when the controller returns the
version number greater than 2.  This is annoying on the machines with
O2 micro chip like many Dell models, where the chip gives 3.
Since it's the only known error case so far, downgrade the print level
so that it won't appear during boot with quiet option.
