Subject: [PATCH] md: fix deadlock error in recent patch.
Git-commit: d47c8ad261f787af22a220ffcc2d07afba809223
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1093023

A recent patch aimed to cause md_write_start() to fail (rather than
block) when the mddev was suspending, so as to avoid deadlocks.
Unfortunately the test in wait_event() was wrong, and it didn't change
behaviour at all.

We wait_event() must wait until the metadata is written OR the array is
suspending.

Fixes: cc27b0c78c79 ("md: fix deadlock between mddev_suspend() and md_write_start()")
