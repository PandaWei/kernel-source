Subject: hv_netvsc: Fix a deadlock by getting rtnl lock earlier in netvsc_probe()
Git-commit: e04e7a7bbd4bbabef4e1a58367e5fc9b2edc3b10
References: bug#1109038

This patch fixes the race between netvsc_probe() and
rndis_set_subchannel(), which can cause a deadlock.

These are the related 3 paths which show the deadlock:

path #1:
    Workqueue: hv_vmbus_con vmbus_onmessage_work [hv_vmbus]
    Call Trace:
     schedule
     schedule_preempt_disabled
     __mutex_lock
     __device_attach
     bus_probe_device
     device_add
     vmbus_device_register
     vmbus_onoffer
     vmbus_onmessage_work
     process_one_work
     worker_thread
     kthread
     ret_from_fork

path #2:
    schedule
     schedule_preempt_disabled
     __mutex_lock
     netvsc_probe
     vmbus_probe
     really_probe
     __driver_attach
     bus_for_each_dev
     driver_attach_async
     async_run_entry_fn
     process_one_work
     worker_thread
     kthread
     ret_from_fork

path #3:
    Workqueue: events netvsc_subchan_work [hv_netvsc]
    Call Trace:
     schedule
     rndis_set_subchannel
     netvsc_subchan_work
     process_one_work
     worker_thread
     kthread
     ret_from_fork

Before path #1 finishes, path #2 can start to run, because just before
the "bus_probe_device(dev);" in device_add() in path #1, there is a line
"object_uevent(&dev->kobj, KOBJ_ADD);", so systemd-udevd can
immediately try to load hv_netvsc and hence path #2 can start to run.

Next, path #2 offloads the subchannal's initialization to a workqueue,
i.e. path #3, so we can end up in a deadlock situation like this:

Path #2 gets the device lock, and is trying to get the rtnl lock;
Path #3 gets the rtnl lock and is waiting for all the subchannel messages
to be processed;
Path #1 is trying to get the device lock, but since #2 is not releasing
the device lock, path #1 has to sleep; since the VMBus messages are
processed one by one, this means the sub-channel messages can't be
procedded, so #3 has to sleep with the rtnl lock held, and finally #2
has to sleep... Now all the 3 paths are sleeping and we hit the deadlock.

With the patch, we can make sure #2 gets both the device lock and the
rtnl lock together, gets its job done, and releases the locks, so #1
and #3 will not be blocked for ever.
