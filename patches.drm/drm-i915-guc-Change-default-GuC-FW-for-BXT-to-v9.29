Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/guc: Change default GuC FW for BXT to v9.29
Git-commit: d416ac780eecc76511fcf15974f54f5e9520cea6
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

This patch makes v9.29 firmware as default firmware for BXT.

Note: GuC logging control is changed with this firmware. GuC is
expecting i915 to set control bit to enable "default logging"
while using GuC action UK_LOG_ENABLE_LOGGING.
However i915 is currently not doing this because it is version
specific change and can be handled entirely in GuC. It will need
to be fixed in future firmwares.

This update includes (since v8.7):

- Added support to log media reset count for host to read it
- BXT WA for fixing MTP hangs. WaDisableDOPRenderClkGatingAtSubmit
- Sub-feature level control for power management features.
- Minor clean-up for power management interface.
- Unified power management interface and scheduler interface into
  1 file using same version.
- Bug Fix for multi context scheduler flag.
- DCC spec changes for BXT + DCT enabling
- Springboard based Pre-ETM/ETM flow enabling for debug signed GuC/HuC
- Moving GuC non_critical r/w data to lower SRAM 64KB
- Enabled IBC for BXT
- Media engine Reset fix.  Correctly marking context for resubmission in
  Media Reset case.
- SLPC Dynamic RPe fix to resolve issues where incorrect frequency was set.
- ABT Disable bug fix. Disabled Evaluation mode on context change.
- GuC clean up to align developer build in line to production build.
- Disable ARAT interrupt before programming ARAT delta.
- Memory range check in Parse to avoid failure due to overflow.
- Clear forcewake in CSB when SQ is empty.
- SLPC IBC 1.6 for APL to ensure multiplier does not cap IA below Pe.
- Move UkGuckmdInterface.h file from 2016 folders to common 2016 folder.
- This is file location change. No functional change done as part of this
  check in.
- 3 tries of wake request needed from GuC2CSME for ME to wake up. Request
  has come from ME spec
- During reset one parameter was not getting accounted
- Enabling Guc Log changes for ultra low logging for OCA
- Disable build.bat redundant prints.
- Move few least used functions to non-critical section.
- Rearrange GuC documentation folder structure.
- Fixing Issue with Default Guc Log changes for OCA using special Control
  Bit
