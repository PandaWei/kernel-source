Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/cfl: Remove alpha support protection.
Git-commit: e6b20bf1b77c24465393b5b1e12781110cedc12c
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

We now have Coffee Lake on our CI systems.

Coffee Lake is at this point in same stage as Kaby Lake.

And it seems that we don't have any risk of bad blank
screens or anything like that. So let's remove the protection.
