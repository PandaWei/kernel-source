Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: make structure intel_sprite_plane_funcs static
Git-commit: 2d56758557bc465a44879b471c84bd09ce8a2aac
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

The structure intel_sprite_plane_funcs is local to the source
and does not need to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warning:
symbol 'intel_sprite_plane_funcs' was not declared. Should it be static?
