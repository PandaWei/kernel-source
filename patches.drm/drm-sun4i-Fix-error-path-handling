Subject: [PATCH] drm/sun4i: Fix error path handling
Git-commit: 92411f6d7f1afcc95e54295d40e96a75385212ec
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc5
References: bsc#1051510

The commit 4c7f16d14a33 ("drm/sun4i: Fix TCON clock and regmap
initialization sequence") moved a bunch of logic around, but forgot to
update the gotos after the introduction of the err_free_dotclock label.

It means that if we fail later that the one introduced in that commit,
we'll just to the old label which isn't free the clock we created. This
will result in a breakage as soon as someone tries to do something with
that clock, since its resources will have been long reclaimed.
