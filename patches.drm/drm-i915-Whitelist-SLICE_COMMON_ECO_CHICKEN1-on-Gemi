Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Whitelist SLICE_COMMON_ECO_CHICKEN1 on Geminilake.
Git-commit: 4636bda86aa1f34f45c629477476a0dcfa04e597
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc8
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900
No-fix: ab062639edb0412daf6de540725276b9a5d217f9

Geminilake requires the 3D driver to select whether barriers are
intended for compute shaders, or tessellation control shaders, by
whacking a "Barrier Mode" bit in SLICE_COMMON_ECO_CHICKEN1 when
switching pipelines.  Failure to do this properly can result in GPU
hangs.

Unfortunately, this means it needs to switch mid-batch, so only
userspace can properly set it.  To facilitate this, the kernel needs
to whitelist the register.

The workarounds page currently tags this as applying to Broxton only,
but that doesn't make sense.  The documentation for the register it
references says the bit userspace is supposed to toggle only exists on
Geminilake.  Empirically, the Mesa patch to toggle this bit appears to
fix intermittent GPU hangs in tessellation control shader barrier tests
on Geminilake; we haven't seen those hangs on Broxton.

V2: Mention WA #0862 in the comment (it doesn't have a name).
