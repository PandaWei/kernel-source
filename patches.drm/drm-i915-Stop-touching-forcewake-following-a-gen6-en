Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Stop touching forcewake following a gen6+ engine reset
Git-commit: 4055dc75d6b51c23602b11c6f716e59b8947ffbf
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

Forcewake is not affected by the engine reset on gen6+. Indeed the
reason why we added intel_uncore_forcewake_reset() to
gen6_reset_engines() was to keep the bookkeeping intact because the
reset did not touch the forcewake bit (yet we cancelled the forcewake
consumers)!  This was done in commit 521198a2e7095:

	drm/i915: sanitize forcewake registers on reset

	In reset we try to restore the forcewake state to
	pre reset state, using forcewake_count. The reset
	doesn't seem to clear the forcewake bits so we
	get warn on forcewake ack register not clearing.

That futzing of the forcewake bookkeeping was dropped in commit
0294ae7b44bb ("drm/i915: Consolidate forcewake resetting to a single
function"), but it did not make the realisation that the remaining
intel_uncore_forcewake_reset() was redundant.

The new danger with using intel_uncore_forcewake_reset() with per-engine
resets is that the driver and hw are still in an active state as we
perform the reset. We may be using the forcewake to read protected
registers elsewhere and those results may be clobbered by the concurrent
dropping of forcewake.
