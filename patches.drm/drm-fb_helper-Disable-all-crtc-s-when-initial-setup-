Subject: [PATCH] drm/fb_helper: Disable all crtc's when initial setup fails.
Git-commit: 52dd06506e9bbc2a37b352df7dfc5468f8da21fd
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc2
References: FATE#322643 bsc#1055900

Some drivers like i915 start with crtc's enabled, but with deferred
fbcon setup they were no longer disabled as part of fbdev setup.
Headless units could no longer enter pc3 state because the crtc was
still enabled.

Fix this by calling restore_fbdev_mode when we would have called
it otherwise once during initial fbdev setup.
