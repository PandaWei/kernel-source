Subject: [PATCH] ubifs: Don't encrypt special files on creation
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: v4.12.4
Git-commit: f34e87f58dabc31eb69f61cf4a79e951d4176743

commit f34e87f58dabc31eb69f61cf4a79e951d4176743 upstream.

When a new inode is created, we check if the containing folder has a encryption
policy set and inherit that. This should however only be done for regular
files, links and subdirectories. Not for sockes fifos etc.

Fixes: d475a507457b ("ubifs: Add skeleton for fscrypto")
