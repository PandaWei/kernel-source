Subject: [PATCH] vmw_balloon: fix VMCI use when balloon built into kernel
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.155
Git-commit: c3cc1b0fc27508da53fe955a3b23d03964410682

commit c3cc1b0fc27508da53fe955a3b23d03964410682 upstream.

Currently, when all modules, including VMCI and VMware balloon are built
into the kernel, the initialization of the balloon happens before the
VMCI is probed. As a result, the balloon fails to initialize the VMCI
doorbell, which it uses to get asynchronous requests for balloon size
changes.

The problem can be seen in the logs, in the form of the following
message:
	"vmw_balloon: failed to initialize vmci doorbell"

The driver would work correctly but slightly less efficiently, probing
for requests periodically. This patch changes the balloon to be
initialized using late_initcall() instead of module_init() to address
this issue. It does not address a situation in which VMCI is built as a
module and the balloon is built into the kernel.
