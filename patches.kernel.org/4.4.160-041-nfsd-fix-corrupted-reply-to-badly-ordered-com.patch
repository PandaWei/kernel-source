Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: fix corrupted reply to badly ordered compound
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.160
Git-commit: 5b7b15aee641904ae269be9846610a3950cbd64c

[ Upstream commit 5b7b15aee641904ae269be9846610a3950cbd64c ]

We're encoding a single op in the reply but leaving the number of ops
zero, so the reply makes no sense.

Somewhat academic as this isn't a case any real client will hit, though
in theory perhaps that could change in a future protocol extension.
