Subject: [PATCH] net: sched: fix NULL pointer dereference when action calls
 some targets
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: v4.12.10
Git-commit: 4f8a881acc9d1adaf1e552349a0b1df28933a04c

[ Upstream commit 4f8a881acc9d1adaf1e552349a0b1df28933a04c ]

As we know in some target's checkentry it may dereference par.entryinfo
to check entry stuff inside. But when sched action calls xt_check_target,
par.entryinfo is set with NULL. It would cause kernel panic when calling
some targets.

It can be reproduce with:
  # tc qd add dev eth1 ingress handle ffff:
  # tc filter add dev eth1 parent ffff: u32 match u32 0 0 action xt \
    -j ECN --ecn-tcp-remove

It could also crash kernel when using target CLUSTERIP or TPROXY.

By now there's no proper value for par.entryinfo in ipt_init_target,
but it can not be set with NULL. This patch is to void all these
panics by setting it with an ipt_entry obj with all members = 0.

Note that this issue has been there since the very beginning.
