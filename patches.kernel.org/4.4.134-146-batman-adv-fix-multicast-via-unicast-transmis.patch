[ Upstream commit f8fb3419ead44f9a3136995acd24e35da4525177 ]

For multicast frames AP isolation is only supposed to be checked on
the receiving nodes and never on the originating one.

Furthermore, the isolation or wifi flag bits should only be intepreted
as such for unicast and never multicast TT entries.

By injecting flags to the multicast TT entry claimed by a single
target node it was verified in tests that this multicast address
becomes unreachable, leading to packet loss.

Omitting the "src" parameter to the batadv_transtable_search() call
successfully skipped the AP isolation check and made the target
reachable again.
