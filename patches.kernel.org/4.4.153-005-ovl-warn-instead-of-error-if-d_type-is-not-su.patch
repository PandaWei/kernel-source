Subject: [PATCH] ovl: warn instead of error if d_type is not supported

commit e7c0b5991dd1be7b6f6dc2b54a15a0f47b64b007 upstream.

overlay needs underlying fs to support d_type. Recently I put in a
patch in to detect this condition and started failing mount if
underlying fs did not support d_type.

But this breaks existing configurations over kernel upgrade. Those who
are running docker (partially broken configuration) with xfs not
supporting d_type, are surprised that after kernel upgrade docker does
not run anymore.

https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/22937#issuecomment-229881315

So instead of erroring out, detect broken configuration and warn
about it. This should allow existing docker setups to continue
working after kernel upgrade.
