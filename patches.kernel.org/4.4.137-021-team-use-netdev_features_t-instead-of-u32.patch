Subject: [PATCH] team: use netdev_features_t instead of u32
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.137
Git-commit: 25ea66544bfd1d9df1b7e1502f8717e85fa1e6e6

[ Upstream commit 25ea66544bfd1d9df1b7e1502f8717e85fa1e6e6 ]

This code was introduced in 2011 around the same time that we made
netdev_features_t a u64 type.  These days a u32 is not big enough to
hold all the potential features.
