Subject: [PATCH] i2c: ismt: Don't duplicate the receive length for block reads
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: v4.12.11
Git-commit: b6c159a9cb69c2cf0bf59d4e12c3a2da77e4d994

commit b6c159a9cb69c2cf0bf59d4e12c3a2da77e4d994 upstream.

According to Table 15-14 of the C2000 EDS (Intel doc #510524) the
rx data pointed to by the descriptor dptr contains the byte count.

desc->rxbytes reports all bytes read on the wire, including the
"byte count" byte.  So if a device sends 4 bytes in response to a
block read, on the wire and in the DMA buffer we see:

count data1 data2 data3 data4
 0x04  0xde  0xad  0xbe  0xef

That's what we want to return in data->block to the next level.

Instead we were actually prefixing that with desc->rxbytes:

bad
count count data1 data2 data3 data4
 0x05  0x04  0xde  0xad  0xbe  0xef

This was discovered while developing a BMC solution relying on the
ipmi_ssif.c driver which was trying to interpret the bogus length
field as part of the IPMI response.
