Subject: [PATCH] USB: yurex: Fix buffer over-read in yurex_write()
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.158
Git-commit: 7e10f14ebface44a48275c8d6dc1caae3668d5a9

commit 7e10f14ebface44a48275c8d6dc1caae3668d5a9 upstream.

If the written data starts with a digit, yurex_write() tries to parse
it as an integer using simple_strtoull().  This requires a null-
terminator, and currently there's no guarantee that there is one.

(The sample program at
https://github.com/NeoCat/YUREX-driver-for-Linux/blob/master/sample/yurex_clock.pl
writes an integer without a null terminator.  It seems like it must
have worked by chance!)

Always add a null byte after the written data.  Enlarge the buffer
to allow for this.
