Subject: [PATCH] usb: storage: return on error to avoid a null pointer
 dereference
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: v4.12.4
Git-commit: 446230f52a5bef593554510302465eabab45a372

commit 446230f52a5bef593554510302465eabab45a372 upstream.

When us->extra is null the driver is not initialized, however, a
later call to osd200_scsi_to_ata is made that dereferences
us->extra, causing a null pointer dereference.  The code
currently detects and reports that the driver is not initialized;
add a return to avoid the subsequent dereference issue in this
check.

Thanks to Alan Stern for pointing out that srb->result needs setting
to DID_ERROR << 16
