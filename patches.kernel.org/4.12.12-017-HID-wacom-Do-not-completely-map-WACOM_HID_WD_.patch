Subject: [PATCH] HID: wacom: Do not completely map
 WACOM_HID_WD_TOUCHRINGSTATUS usage
References: bnc#1060662
Patch-mainline: v4.12.12
Git-commit: 8d411cbf46e515ca2b7ceb3d2b3f43e22813edac

commit 8d411cbf46e515ca2b7ceb3d2b3f43e22813edac upstream.

The WACOM_HID_WD_TOUCHRINGSTATUS usage is a single bit which tells us
whether the touchring is currently in use or not. Because we need to
reset the axis value to 0 when the finger is removed, we call
'wacom_map_usage' to ensure that the required type/code values are
associated with the usage. The 'wacom_map_usage' also sets up the axis
range and resolution, however, which is not desired in this particular
case.

Although xf86-input-wacom doesn't do really do anything with the ring's
range or resolution, the libinput driver (for Wayland environments)
uses these values to provide proper angle indications to userspace.
