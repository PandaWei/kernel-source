Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx6q: Use correct SDMA script for SPI5 core
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.140
Git-commit: df07101e1c4a29e820df02f9989a066988b160e6

commit df07101e1c4a29e820df02f9989a066988b160e6 upstream.

According to the reference manual the shp_2_mcu / mcu_2_shp
scripts must be used for devices connected through the SPBA.

This fixes an issue we saw with DMA transfers.
Sometimes the SPI controller RX FIFO was not empty after a DMA
transfer and the driver got stuck in the next PIO transfer when
it read one word more than expected.

commit dd4b487b32a35 ("ARM: dts: imx6: Use correct SDMA script
for SPI cores") is fixing the same issue but only for SPI1 - 4.

Fixes: 677940258dd8e ("ARM: dts: imx6q: enable dma for ecspi5")
