Subject: [PATCH] fs/cifs: don't translate SFM_SLASH (U+F026) to backslash
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.160
Git-commit: c15e3f19a6d5c89b1209dc94b40e568177cb0921

[ Upstream commit c15e3f19a6d5c89b1209dc94b40e568177cb0921 ]

When a Mac client saves an item containing a backslash to a file server
the backslash is represented in the CIFS/SMB protocol as as U+F026.
Before this change, listing a directory containing an item with a
backslash in its name will return that item with the backslash
represented with a true backslash character (U+005C) because
convert_sfm_character mapped U+F026 to U+005C when interpretting the
CIFS/SMB protocol response.  However, attempting to open or stat the
path using a true backslash will result in an error because
convert_to_sfm_char does not map U+005C back to U+F026 causing the
CIFS/SMB request to be made with the backslash represented as U+005C.

This change simply prevents the U+F026 to U+005C conversion from
happenning.  This is analogous to how the code does not do any
translation of UNI_SLASH (U+F000).
